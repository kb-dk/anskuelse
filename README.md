# anskuelse

Visualisation of large images with multiple sub-areas of interest.

Work in progress is published at 
https://labs.statsbiblioteket.dk/anskuelse/adams_history/

## Note

Working with this requires a tile package, which is currently not part of this repository as there are too many files. Hopefully these will be uploaded somewhere in the near future.

## Ideas

* Automatic zooming and panning when the user is inactive
* Annotation-display using overlays. Currently a proof of concept can be seen at the globe in the lower left corner on the dmeo page
* Annotation-additions using an edit-mode or similar
