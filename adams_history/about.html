    <h2>Technical</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The base presentation was created using the excellent tool <a href="https://jcupitt.github.io/libvips/">libvips</a> for image processing and the equally excellent <a href="https://openseadragon.github.io/">OpenSeadragon</a> for display</li>
        <li>Bookmarking functionality was added using callback-hooks and the zoom &amp; pan-API from OpenSeadragon, with a bit of JavaScript-glue</li>
        <li>The Area Of Interest proof of concept (hover over the globe in the lower left corner) was added by hand, using the overlay-API from OpenSeadragon</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Plans</h2>
    <p>
        We see the current KB Labs-product as a quick take and would like to extend it.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>One of the interesting properties of the Adams piece is the huge amount of distinct information that it holds. There are thousands of areas of interests, from <a href="./#x:0.6238,y:0.01968,w:0.02604,h:0.01564">a 10 horned beast</a> to <a href="./#x:0.9197,y:0.07040,w:0.01302,h:0.007819">the cardiovascular system</a>. This calls for an accessible annotation system with a visualization of the areas of interest that does not overwhelm the user. One technical challenge here is that OpenSeadragon overlays does not scale well into thousands of overlays</li>
        <li>The Adams piece is visually impressive and displays well on large screens. Adding a demo-mode where the view is automatically panned &amp; zoomed is one way of keep such a display interesting. It could be a random walk or it could be between pre-selected areas of interest. It would combine well with annotations</li>
    </ul>
